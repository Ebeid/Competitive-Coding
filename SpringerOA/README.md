## Code to download books from Springer Open Access 

1. If you go to https://www.springeropen.com/books you will find a url on the bottom of the page says "Browse our open access books" to access thousands of free books. 
2. If you follow this url and click the download search results as CSV button, you will get similar file like the one in this folder.
3. The code in this folder uses this csv file and go download all the books locally. 

I was just playing with .Net code, no one needs all these books at once :)
